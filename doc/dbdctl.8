.SH "NAME"
\fBdbdctl\fR
.
.SH "NAME"
dattobd \- Control the Datto block device kernel module\.
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBdbdctl <sub\-command> [<args>]\fR
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBdbdctl\fR is the userspace tool used to manage the dattobd kernel module\. It provides an interface to create, delete, reload, transition, and configure on\-disk snapshots and certain parameters of the kernel module itself\.
.
.P
This manual page describes \fBdbdctl\fR briefly\. More detail is available in the Git repository located at https://github\.com/datto/dattobd\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.
.nf

\-c cache\-size
     Specify how big the in\-memory data cache can grow to (in MB)\. Defaults to 300 MB\.

\-f fallocate
     Specify the maximum size of the COW file on disk\.

.SH "SUB\-COMMANDS"
.
.SS "setup\-snapshot"
\fBdbdctl setup\-snapshot [\-c <cache size>] [\-f <fallocate>] <block device> <cow file path> <minor number>\fR
.
.P
Sets up a snapshot\.
.
.SS "reload\-snapshot"
\fBdbdctl reload\-snapshot [\-c <cache size>] <block device> <cow file> <minor>\fR
.
.P
Reloads a COW file that was in snapshot mode\.
.
.P
This command is meant to be run before block devices are mounted\. It notifies the kernel driver to expect the block device specified to come back online\.
.
.SS "reload\-incremental"
\fBdbdctl reload\-incremental [\-c <cache size>] <block device> <cow file> <minor>\fR
.
.P
Reloads a COW file that was in incremental mode\.
.
.SS "transition\-to\-snapshot"
\fBdbdctl transition\-to\-snapshot [\-f <fallocate>] <cow file> <minor>\fR
.
.P
Transitions a COW file in incremental mode to snapshot mode\.
.
.SS "transition\-to\-incremental"
\fBdbdctl transition\-to\-incremental <minor>\fR
.
.P
Transitions a snapshot COW file to incremental mode\.
.
.SS "destroy"
\fBdbdctl destroy <minor>\fR
.
.P
Cleanly and completely removes the snapshot or incremental file corresponding to the given block device minor number\.
.
.SS "reconfigure"
\fBdbdctl reconfigure [\-c <cache size>] <minor>\fR
.
.P
Allows you to reconfigure various parameters of a snapshot while it is online\.
.
.SS "EXAMPLES"
\fB# dbdctl setup\-snapshot /dev/sda1 /var/backup/datto\-backup 4\fR
.
.P
This command will setup a new COW snapshot device tracking \fB/dev/sda1\fR at \fB/dev/datto4\fR\. This block device is backed by a new file created at the path \fB/var/backup/datto\-backup\fR\.
.
.P
NOTE: The COW file responsible for maintaining snapshots of a filesystem MUST RESIDE on the SAME block device as the filesystem it is snapshotting!
.
.P
\fB# dbdctl reload\-snapshot /dev/sda1 /var/backup/datto\-backup 4\fR
.
.P
This will notify the driver that the COW snapshot file located at \fB/var/backup/datto\-backup\fR is tracking \fB/dev/sda1\fR, and that the resulting block device should be \fB/dev/datto4\fR\.
.
.P
NOTE: The path to the COW file is relative \fITO THE ROOT OF THE VOLUME ON WHICH THE FILE IS LOCATED\fR, \fBNOT\fR \fB/\fR!
.
.P
\fB# dbdctl reload\-incremental /dev/sda5 /var/backup/datto\-backup <whatever the minor number is>\fR
.
.P
This will notify the driver that the COW incremental file located at \fB/var/backup/datto\-backup\fR is tracking \fB/dev/sda1\fR, and that the resulting block device created by the driver should be \fB/dev/datto4\fR\.
.
.P
NOTE: The path to the COW file is relative \fITO THE ROOT OF THE VOLUME ON WHICH THE FILE IS LOCATED\fR, \fBNOT\fR \fB/\fR!
.
.P
\fB# dbdctl destroy 5\fR
.
.P
This will destroy the block device located at \fB/dev/datto5\fR, delete the COW file backing it, and perform all other cleanup relating to that device\.
.
.P
\fB# dbdctl transition\-to\-incremental 5\fR
.
.P
Transitions the Datto device specified by the minor number to incremental mode\.
.
.P
\fB# dbdctl transition\-to\-snapshot /var/backup/datto\-backup 5\fR
.
.P
Transitions the incremental COW file indicated by the minor number to snapshot mode\.
.
.P
\fB# dbdctl reconfigure \-c 400 5\fR
.
.P
Reconfigures the snapshot at \fB/dev/datto5\fR to have an in\-memory cache size of 400 MB\.
